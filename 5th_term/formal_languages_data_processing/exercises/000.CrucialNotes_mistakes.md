- We **dont** have to introduce a `$` and a `S'->S     $`, it is just good practise to do so. We can just have entry in the parsing table where we read in nothing as the lookahead symbol.
- multiple entries in LALR(1)-parsing table makes it **not** LALR(1), it can be either shift/shift, reduce/reduce, reduce/shift

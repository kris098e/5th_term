# data cleaning
1. Find all the problems in the following [data set](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/kslarsen/dm565/Files/fileForDataCleaning.tsv), which is described as listing given name, family name, CPR number, zip code (Danish), city, date for an MS degree, and whether or not the person has a Ph.D. Let the lecture slides on data cleaning inspire you in your search. Discuss which kind of problems you have found, the methods you used for finding them, and which ones can be fixed and how? [Some browsers may open the file with some (csv) application; to avoid this, you may be able to right-click and save the file that way ("Save link as..." or something similar).]
## Correct flaws
fx correct the fact taht we both have `J, Y` as as true value for the person being a PHD. can use
```bash
grep -E -i "(Y$)|(j$)" fileForDataCleaning.tsv
```
and then correct the ones with `y` or `j`.

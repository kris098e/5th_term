- We ofc start with removing the sates which are not reachable
- for `W` we can choose to just keep `F` or `Q\F`
**enter the while loop**

- remove a set from `W`, but we only have 1

# data cleaning
1. Find all the problems in the following [data set](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/kslarsen/dm565/Files/fileForDataCleaning.tsv), which is described as listing given name, family name, CPR number, zip code (Danish), city, date for an MS degree, and whether or not the person has a Ph.D. Let the lecture slides on data cleaning inspire you in your search. Discuss which kind of problems you have found, the methods you used for finding them, and which ones can be fixed and how? [Some browsers may open the file with some (csv) application; to avoid this, you may be able to right-click and save the file that way ("Save link as..." or something similar).]
## Correct flaws
fx correct the fact taht we both have `J, Y` as as true value for the person being a PHD. can use
```bash
grep -E -i "(Y$)|(j$)" fileForDataCleaning.tsv
```
and then correct the ones with `y` or `j`.

- some of the first names has very unique characters, so we can do 
```bash
grep -E '^[^[:alnum]]'
```
- many of the CPR numbers does not have the correct checksum, this of course cannot be fixed
```bash
cut -f3 file.tsv | grep -E -v '[[:digit:]]{6}-[[:digit:]]{4}'
# this checks the cpr number column, to see something that does not match the cpr-number format

grep -E '[^[:alnum:]]$' # check if the last column, the Y/N column if it actually has a alphanumeric character
```
### Fix flaws
- cpr number formatting
- date formatting
- if the city and the postal code does not match, we can choose fx to just use the postal code and find the city
- the lines that used spaces instead of tabs, which will fuck up our regexes

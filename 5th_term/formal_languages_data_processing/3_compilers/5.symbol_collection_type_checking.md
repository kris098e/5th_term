# Symbol collection
task is to build the symbol table, via recursive visits 
## which scope
`static, dynamic`
## what can be seen in the functions
see page 12 [[10_symbol_checking.pdf#page=12]]
## Symbol table
create a table for all symbols, if we fx meet `A` then we create a branch and add which symbols we can get in `A`. 
Create one for each scope

### Static scope
if we are in the lower left, then we can check if there fx is an x, if not, it can go to func f, and if not here we can see in global symtab. We cannot see what is in g.

can be implemented in `c or python`: [[10_symbol_checking.pdf#page=15]]
## in practise 
recusively go down through the AST with visitors. It works like brackets going down, when having these scopes we go one level down and introduce a new bracket

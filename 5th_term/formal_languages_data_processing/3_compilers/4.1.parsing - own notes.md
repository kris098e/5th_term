# Operations
there are 4 operations:

# Stack
see the stack as what is currently in what has been parsed. The stack is the one being manipulated all the time, and when we
- reduce: use a rule to pop stuff of stack and then add what is on the left most side of the rule to the stack. **SEE below definition on what to do whenever we get the reduce.**
- go to: just go to some state and don't anything with the input yet
- shift: put what is in the input on the stack and go to the new state

- See that fx to get to state 2, we get the `x` and now since we dont have anything on the right hand side, we can reduce. 
- when we get `(` we go to state 3. Now since we have `.` on the left side of a rule, we add the options of the rule, which in this case gives us the rule `L->.S` then we also have to follow this rule. Now if we are in state `3` and read a `x` we go to state 2, shifting x on the stack and can reduce. If we get a `L` then we go to state `2`
- remember if we take a rule, then we go to the state which is stated on the the rule

## Explaining the situation in this state
![[Pasted image 20231004114432.png]]
- At first we have `S'` which will always have the `$` as the lookahead symbol. 
- When we then get to `S`, we apply the rule of `S` and keep the same symbol as what was for the rule `S`.
- Then since we have `S->.XX, $` we have to apply `X`. Now since it is behind another `X`, then it will have lookahead symbol which is in the `FIRST(X)`, which is `{a|b}`.

**READ an S**
- When we transition we always keep the same lookahead symbol for the rule.
- but see for the `X` rule below, it is behind the `$`, meaning we cannot change the the lookahead symbol as FIRST(`$`), is `$`

### Notes on this
We see that state `3,6` are the same, but with just different lookahead symbols. these we can combine to make the number of states smaller.
**we can do this because** it would be the same state in the DFA
## LALR(1)
This is combining the states which looks the same, but has different lookahead symbols. Fx, there is `4,7`, `3,6`, `8,9` which are the same, but different lookahead symbols

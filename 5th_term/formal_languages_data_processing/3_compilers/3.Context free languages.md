# Context free languages
fx a language where we are able to count how many times a certain char is written

it is not possible to recognise exactly ${a^iba^i|i\geq 0}$ since then we will have to recognise  other strings as well. 

# Grammar
`terminals`: the symbols which cannot get us any further in the syntax definition
`start-symbol`: One of the variable we are supposed to start with
`productions/rules`: the rules for what the specific symbol can go to.
`parse tree`: the possibilities of where to go

> A grammar **recognises a language**. Fx, we have a grammar `G`, then if we follow the syntax, the string is then in `L(G)`

## Design tips
- if having a lot of `if, while...` then make a variable, fx $S_{while}$ which can handle this.
- DFA can be converted to a grammar
	- fx $q_{i}\to aq_{j}$
- Generate linked information together
- Have enough variables, have one for each recursive construct
## Ambiguity
A grammar parse tree can lead to different expressions

If you can make two parse trees that looks different, but concludes the same, then it is ambiguous

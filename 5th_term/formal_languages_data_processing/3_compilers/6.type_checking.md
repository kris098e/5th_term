# how many programs are correctly typed
- This is undecidable.
	- we can only define some rules for it
- some programming languages does not type-check before beginning the program
## example
- $E_{1}+E_{2}$
	- define requirement: $E_{1},E_{2}$ are both ints
	- requirement: result is type int
## example
- x:=E
	- require x defined to be type of E
	- require result
		- could have none
		- could have some result
## example
- f($E_{1},E_{2}\dots E_{k}$)
	- req:
		- f declared as function
		- maybe with `k` formal parameters
		- $x_{i}$ declares as type of $E_{i}$ where $x_{i}$ is the actual paramater
# Coersion
## Example
- "file" + 42
	- this is string + 42, what to do
		- coerce what to do
## assign compatability
x:=42
x:=false
what if `x` is an int here, what to do
## Type equivalence
type: X is
1. record of
	1. a: int
	2. n: record of
		1. b: int
		2. c: boolean
**this is may fx be a struct**
### Example
x: X (val x is of type X)
x.n.b = 42

`t.lhs` is the current node `t` and `lhs` is left hand side, i.e the variable

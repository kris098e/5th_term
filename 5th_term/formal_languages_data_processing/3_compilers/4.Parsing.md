`NULL,FIRST,FOLLOW`
A "null first follow" context-free grammar is not a standard term in formal language theory or context-free grammar theory. However, it's possible you may be referring to two different concepts related to context-free grammars: nullable symbols and FIRST and FOLLOW sets. Let me explain each of these concepts:

1. Nullable Symbols:
    
    - Nullable symbols in a context-free grammar are non-terminal symbols that can derive the empty string (ε). In other words, if a non-terminal symbol can produce ε as a derivation, it is considered nullable.
    - Nullable symbols play a role in parsing because they can be used to handle optional parts of a production.
2. FIRST Set:
    
    - The FIRST set of a non-terminal or terminal symbol in a context-free grammar consists of all the terminal symbols that can appear as the first symbol in a string derived from that symbol. It also includes ε (the empty string) if the symbol can derive ε as a valid derivation.
    - Calculating the FIRST set is important for predictive parsing (LL(1)) to determine which production to use based on the next input symbol.
3. FOLLOW Set:
    
    - The FOLLOW set of a non-terminal symbol in a context-free grammar consists of all the terminal symbols that can immediately follow that non-terminal symbol in a valid derivation.
    - Calculating the FOLLOW set is important for predictive parsing (LL(1)) to resolve parsing decisions, such as which production to apply when there are multiple choices.

In the context of a context-free grammar, you might need to compute the nullable symbols, FIRST sets, and FOLLOW sets to facilitate parsing. These concepts help ensure that a parser can correctly and unambiguously recognize and parse a language defined by the grammar.

If you have a specific grammar or problem related to these concepts, please provide more details, and I can offer more targeted assistance.
### NULL
can we terminate
### FIRST
What we can get first in a string, i.e the first char, by following the syntax
### FOLLOW
# Top down parser
Follow the parser table, and always take the left most option and use that rule.

Use the parser tree, and use `FIRST, FOLLOW, NULL` in a clever way to reach to the bottom

The input is the one in top. Use the given rule 
1. if input $\in$ FIRST(input)
2. or if input is NULLABLE, and $t\in$ FOLLOW(X|Y|Z)
if it works we add it to the LL(input)

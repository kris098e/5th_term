# Motivation
- Focus on more on testing
	- framework for kotlin
	- give more context into testing
	- `understand how these tools and concepts can be used`
	- explain more about what kotlin multiplatform is
- `the goal of the thesis is to analyze the tools and platforms`

- number 4 point
	- define what is kapt
	- clarify what you want to focus on
		- analyze the frameworks and platforms and what you want

# plan of activities
- start by looking into state of the art
- get a book in or two
	- different schools of testing
		- london school
		- ..
	- dont have to read it all

# development
1.  get use cases
2. test the use cases in kotlin native and multiplatform
	1. I will compare the difference ...
3. I am extending the framework via using the libraries
4. bring this up, this should be the research on the state of the art
5. will look into the best practises of testing


have to write about why it is interesting

# Experiments
1. .
2. ease of use you cannot test.
	1. if times allows I will
	2. last part should be in research phase, What is the state of the art

# tentative time plan
1. can avoid stating that testinf wonr be long
2. remove `first month` just month
	1. dont have to specify details


february for research
marts for mocking of classes and spies


End of may focus on writing


if cannot implement it, do quality checks of the frameworks

# outcome
- add description of what you have done and state of the art

# ddd
look into the topics of books

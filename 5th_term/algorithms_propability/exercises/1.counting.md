for the first possibility we have 10 digits 3 times, and three uppercase english letters that is 26 possibilites 3 times. Meaning the first possibility has
$$p_{1}=10^3*26^3$$
and the 2nd option i the same only reversed. 
$$p_{2}=10^3*26^3$$
Meaning we have a total probability of
$$p_{1}+p_{2}$$

for two 0s we have 5 left, i.e
$$2^5$$
for three 1s we have 4 left, i.e
$$2^4$$
meaning there are 
$$2^5+2^4-2^2$$
Since we have overcounted by $2^2$ for the ones which starts with 2 0s. possible bit strings

![[Pasted image 20230911083245.png]]
number multiples of p: q
and vice versa
number of not coprime to n = p+q-1

the result will then be n-(p+q-1)=pq-p-q+1=p(q-1)+q+1...

two tasks: m1, m2=$m1*m2$ number of ways to do m1 followed by m2

$m_{1}*m_{2}\dots*m_{k}$
for k+1 we can just do the first k tasks and then add the task $m_{k+1}$ to the list
# Chapter 6.2 Pigeon hole principle
![[Pasted image 20230911083929.png]]
Since there are only 26 letters in the english alphabet, we have 30 students, i.e 30 possible start letters, but only 26 letters to choose from, then 2 must have same starting letter 

![[Pasted image 20230911084052.png]]
a. We use $$\lceil \frac{n}{r}\rceil\geq3=\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil\geq3$$
$r=2$ since we have 2 "holes", 2 colors
which means that $$n=5$$ will suffice.

b. 13
![[Pasted image 20230911084517.png]]
since we have more pigeons than crates, or more input than output, then two of the input must be mapped to the same output

![[Pasted image 20230911084656.png]]
using the pigeon principle, we have 4 possibilities 
1. even, even
2. even, odd
3. odd, even
4. even odd
since we have 5 points, it has to be one of the 4 possibilities which is already covered by another point.


![[Pasted image 20230911085514.png]]
a.
the formula $$\lceil \frac{n}{r}\rceil=\lceil \frac{9}{2}\rceil$$
shows that of the two options {male, female} there must be one of the classes which has 5 elements in the set

b.
if there are 3 male students, then there cannot be at least 7 females. It also is true in the reverse case.

![[Pasted image 20230911085934.png]]
Have some people
$P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}\dots P_{101}$

For each person $p_{i}$ there exists $(D_{i},I_{i})$  where $D_{i}$ is longest decreasing sequence and $I_{i}$ is longest increasing sequence
all of the D and I are assumed to be at most 10. **we use the fact that they can only be at max 10 is used to form the contradiction, which will later be used to prove that they have to be able to take values of >10**. We then have $10*10=100$ possibilities for the tuple. However as we have 101 persons, meaning that must exists two people which has the same tuple associated with it. we have person J and person I which has the same tuple. If J is taller and before, then it is decreasing and vice versa.


![[Pasted image 20230911090005.png]]
two options, be either enemy or friends, we have the formula where $$\ceil \frac{n}{r}$$
When we pick one out of the group we have n = 4 and r = 2 still, meaning that we can only gurantee that there are 2 mutual enemies or friends, not 3

![[Pasted image 20230911090251.png]]
Since the most is 200,000 hairs and more than 800,000 people with having at least 1 hair, then if we had the biggest spread possible, then there would be 4 sets of {1, 2, 3...200,000}, and the beginning of a new set, since there are more than 800,000 - then there must be 5 people which has the same amount of hair.

![[Pasted image 20230911091113.png]]
connect 4 computers to all 4 printers, 
Connect the rest to one printer each or connect the 5th computer to all 4 of the printers.

Meaning we have to use 20 cables

This works since each printer have to have exactly 5 cables each, such that if you choose 4 computers, i.e you should be able to pick 1 and then have 3 computers which is not connected. Which means you can always pick 4 computers and have connection to all printers. 


![[Pasted image 20230911091233.png]]
If there are 2 people, and they know each other then its true, It is also true if they dont know each other. When a new person enters, if one of these people know the person, then its still true, it is also true if they know the person. This continues

We can use the formula 
$$\ceil \frac{n}{r}$$
Where at first we have 2 people, and at best we have 1 possible connection - which means that we fit 2 people into 1 connection. Next we have 3 people and at best a guy can have two connections, i.e n=3 & r=2. This continues.

let $L={1,3,5,7,9}$
$$\sum_{i\in L}c(10,i)$$
![[Pasted image 20230911092830.png]]
a. $2^8$
b. We want to choose 3 from 8 to be heads. 3 heads: ${8 \choose 3} = 56$ outcomes
c. 
- 3 heads: ${8 \choose 3} = 56$ outcomes
- 4 heads: ${8 \choose 4} = 70$ outcomes
- 5 heads: ${8 \choose 5} = 56$ outcomes
- 6 heads: ${8 \choose 6} = 28$ outcomes
- 7 heads: ${8 \choose 7} = 8$ outcomes
- 8 heads: ${8 \choose 8} = 1$ outcome 

So, the total number of outcomes with at least 3 heads is $56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 219$ outcomes.
d. From 8 elements we can choose 4, meaning we have $c(8,4)=70$

We see that all of the numerators will be the same when we multiply, meaning that we can just multiply these together in the entire equation. Next up we will multiply the denominators, giving us the equation:
![[Pasted image 20230913085255.png]]
We see that when we multiply them together, we just get the same equation on both sides of the `=`

Fix on mathematicians, want to see in how many ways we can choose the number of mathematicians in the comittee, i.e `k` is the number of mathematicians. We have to start from `k=1` since we have to have mathematician as the leader. We sum up to n since we allow all of the mathematicians as well

On the right side, we can choose the leader in `n` ways so we fix this. we can choose `2n-1` people, since we have already fixed a leader. And since we have `n-1` people left to choose, this is the correct number of ways to pick them.

- on the left side:
	- we fix on the mathematicians, i.e `k`-mathematicians. So we have to choose one mathematician, therefore we start from `1`. then we have $n \choose k$ options of picking the mathematicians. if we fx have that `k=2` then we have `2` choises for choosing the leader. But we also have to choose `n-k` computer science professors, but since ${n \choose k}={n\choose n-k}$ we simply have ${n\choose k}^2$. 
	- for $k=\{1,2,3,4\dots n\}$ since we there are different outcomes if we choose to include 1 mathematics professor than if we fx include 2 mathematics professors
- right side:
	- we can choose the leader in `n` ways so we fix this. we can choose `2n-1` people, since we have already fixed a leader. And since we have `n-1` people left to choose, this is the correct number of ways to pick them.

let n=number of letters

then there are $n^6$ different strings

![[Pasted image 20230912142439.png]]
We have
n = 3, r = 5

meaning we have $(3+5-1)\choose{5}$ ways

![[Pasted image 20230912142542.png]]
We have n = 5, and we want to choose 20, we do not care about ordering, as they are just in the same jar.

This means we have
$(5+20-1)\choose{20}$ ways

![[Pasted image 20230912142623.png]]
We have
n=4 and r=17, since we can choose from 4 elements, and we can at max choose 17 with repetition.
there are $(4+17-1)\choose{17}$ ways


![[Pasted image 20230912142642.png]]
We have n=3, a possible solution is to choose 0 since that 0 <= 11, choose 1, 2...
there are $\sum_{i=0}^{11}$ $(3+i-1)\choose{i}$


![[Pasted image 20230912142658.png]]
we have 
n=11
r=11
we have 
1xM
4xI
4xS
2xP

This means that we have the calculation $\frac{11!}{4!4!2!}$
since we have 11! permutations, and we want to remove the permutations of I, S and P since we cannot recognize which I, S P there is on a specific position

See **Indistinguishable boxes** as: if we could distinguish the, then putting all in 1 box would 3 possibilities. fx putting all in box1, all in box2, all in box3.
Now if we cannot distinguish them, then we cannot know that when we put balls in a box and take them up, and them put them down again, that we didnt just put them into the same box as before.

_think of the example_ all boxes looks exactly the same. We put all balls into one box and then take them up. We shuffle the boxes and put it into a random box again, but we dont know if this is the same scenario as before, since we cannot distinguish them from each other.

$${14\choose 6}{8 \choose 8}$$
we want to choose 6 ones out of 14, and for each of these choosings we can choose 8 different spots for the 0's

## Exercise lesson notes
can also use $$\frac{14!}{6!8!}$$

a.
$${40\choose 10} * {30\choose 10} * {20\choose 10} *{10\choose 10}$$
Because we have 10 ways to choose from 40, then 10 choose 30 for these ...

b.
$$\frac{{40\choose 10} * {30\choose 10} * {20\choose 10} *{10\choose 10}}{4!}$$
Since we have 4! permutations of the boxes, and we in `a` used the possibility of using the permutations of the 4 different boxes which we want to remove now
## Lesson notes
a.
or use $$\frac{40!}{10!10!10!10!}$$
![[Pasted image 20230918095451.png]]
$${52 \choose 7}{45 \choose 7}{38 \choose 7}{31 \choose 7}{24 \choose 7}$$
Because we have 52 choose 7 for the first, next up we have 45 left.
We dont care about the ordering of persons nor the cards
## Lesson notes
or use the $$\frac{52!}{{7!}^5*17!}$$
where we mean that we dont care about how the fist 7 are permuted, the next 7 permuted, and then we want to remove 17! since we dont care about the cards which has not been used
![[Pasted image 20230918095511.png]]
We have variables counting how many books we have already skipped. We have to use at least 4, so we fix 4 of the variables to be at least 1 each. This means we have 3 left for the remaining. I.e in 6 variables variables, we have have to skip 7. We then have to choose 3 more bars, from 6 variables with repetitions.

In this exercise we are interested in numbers which are divisible by 
$$\{2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25,6^2=36,7^2=49,8^2=64,9^2=81\}$$
However as no numbers below 100 is divisible by more than 49, only looks at
$$\{4,9,16,25,36,49\}$$
Now, fitting 1 condition, i.e being divisble by only one number in the list is:
- $\frac{99}{4}=24$
- $\frac{99}{9}=11$
- $\frac{99}{16}=6$
- $\frac{99}{25}=3$
- $\frac{99}{36}=2$
- $\frac{99}{49}=2$

Now as we have overcounted some of the numbers, as fx the numbers included in divisible by 16 is also in the ones for 4, we want to remove those by subtracting these
- divisible by both 9 and 4: $\frac{99}{4*9}=2$
- divisible by 4 and 16 (since 16 is multiplum of 4, we remove all that 16 overcounts, as set for 16 is just a subset of 4): $\frac{99}{16}=6$
- ...
as we removed too many, i.e the ones where 3 conditions are met, we have to add them again
- as an example, divisible by 4, 9 and 36, as 36 are divisble by 4 and 9, we have to add the ones which are divisble by 36 again, which is $\frac{99}{36}=2$

next up is 4 conditions ... where we will subtract these
we end up 
$$S-S_{1}+S_{2}-S_{3}=99-(24+11+6+3+2+2)+\dots$$

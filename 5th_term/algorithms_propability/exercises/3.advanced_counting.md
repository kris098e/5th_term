In this exercise we are interested in numbers which are divisible by 
$$\{2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25,6^2=36,7^2=49,8^2=64,9^2=81\}$$
However as no numbers below 100 is divisible by more than 49, only looks at
**would have been a good idea to remove 16 36 84 and 81** since they are divisible by the some of the others, fx 4 and 9.
$$\{4,9,16,25,36,49\}$$
Now, fitting 1 condition, i.e being divisible by only one number in the list is:
- $\frac{99}{4}=24$
- $\frac{99}{9}=11$
- $\frac{99}{16}=6$
- $\frac{99}{25}=3$
- $\frac{99}{36}=2$
- $\frac{99}{49}=2$

Now as we have overcounted some of the numbers, as fx the numbers included in divisible by 16 is also in the ones for 4, we want to remove those by subtracting these
- divisible by both 9 and 4: $\frac{99}{4*9}=2$
- divisible by 4 and 16 (since 16 is multiplum of 4, we remove all that 16 overcounts, as set for 16 is just a subset of 4): $\frac{99}{16}=6$
- ...
as we removed too many, i.e the ones where 3 conditions are met, we have to add them again
- as an example, divisible by 4, 9 and 36, as 36 are divisble by 4 and 9, we have to add the ones which are divisble by 36 again, which is $\frac{99}{36}=2$

next up is 4 conditions ... where we will subtract these
we end up 
$$S-S_{1}+S_{2}-S_{3}=99-(24+11+6+3+2+2)+\dots$$
## In class
get all squares, then remove those that are divisble by one of them, and then add the ones that are divisble by two of the numbers as these have been removed too many

We count onto functions, as no bin must not be empty.
we can count all functions by $3^8$

$A_{i}=$konfigurationer hvor urne `i` er tom

We want to calculate how many options there are where at least 1 urn is empty, and subtract this from all possibilites of the urn combinations. The number of ways we can have 1 urn empty is
$${3\choose 2} \cdot 2^8$$
Since we can choose 2 urns out of the 3 to put in in 3 choose 2 ways, and then there are 2 possibilities for each of the balls. 
Now if we are to choose where only 1 urn has balls that is
$${3\choose 1}1^8$$

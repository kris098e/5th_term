In total there are 26 ace and hearts, i.e $$\frac{4+13-1}{52}$$
4 aces, 12 cards left for red

we can first choose from 40 cards since king, queen and knight we cannot choose.

$$\frac{{40\choose 1}{4\choose 1}{4\choose 1}{4\choose 1}{4\choose 1}}{52\choose 5}$$
Since at first we can choose from 40 cards, next we have to choose 1 out of the 4 possible colours of the next valid card. We continue with this path

We just see how many possibilites there are of each and dividing by the sample space
for two dice: $$\frac{5}{6^6}$$
for three dice:
$$\frac{21}{6*6*6}$$

a.
![[Pasted image 20230918113120.png]]
We find the probability that we dont hit a 6 4 times, as these are independent events we just multiply them. Then we subtract this from 1, and get the probability of hitting a one at least once

b.
![[Pasted image 20230918113427.png]]
We do the same as before calculcating the probability of this not happening and find the probability of it happening by subtracting it from 1

c.
look at a! yes!

On the left side, we calculate the probability by finding the size of unique elements given by the union and dividing by total number in the sample space.

Meaning on the left side we only count unique elements, on the right side, we overcount as we dont care about uniquness
## Formal proof / proof by induction
![[Pasted image 20230918155601.png]]
We cross it out since we know that it can only be between 0 and 1


![[Pasted image 20230918114132.png]]
Since E is calculated by unique elements, then we add the unique elements in F we can only get a probability which is >= max(p(E), p(F))

![[7.2_12E.excalidraw]]
The most amount of uniqure elemtns in F can possibly be 20% as E fills up 80%.

![[Pasted image 20230918114730.png]]
Probability of the first being being heads = $\frac{1}{2}$

head = 1
tails = 0

first being head: {1,0,0,0,0}
all possibilites is $2^5$ 

Intersection
{1,1,1,1,0}
{1,1,1,0,1}
{1,1,0,1,1}
{1,0,1,1,1}

$$\frac{\left( \frac{4}{2^5} \right)}{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{4}$$

$$\frac{\frac{{4\choose 3}}{2^8}}{0.5}$$
4 choose 3 because we can choose 3 of the last 4 to be heads and then we divide by the possibility throwing a heads for the first one

a.
the possibility of picking the string with only 1 bits is $$1-\left( \frac{1}{2^{10}} \right)$$
b.
success, pick a 1
failure pick a 0

The events of picking are independent, so we can use bernolli trials
$${10\choose 10}0.6^{10}*(1-0.4)^{10-10}$$
As we have `n=10` we pick `10` the possibility of picking the correct solution each time is `0.6`, and we need to do this 10 times. As these events are independent we multiply them together. As there are no restrictions for the some other elements (fx if we had to pick 10 out of 12) then we have not chance of the failures

c.
Since we have to choose 10 out of 10, the success of the first element is $\frac{1}{2}$ as the next element has $\frac{1}{2^2}$ of being a success and these are independent events, we multiply them to get the possibility that we have 2 1's in a row. We continue with this and get the proabability of the event is

a.
E=atleast 1x6
F=sum is 7
$$p(F|E)=\frac{p(E\cap F)}{p(E)}=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{11}{36}}=\frac{2}{11}$$

$$P(E)=1-\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2=\frac{11}{36}$$
$$p(E\cap F)=\frac{2}{36}$$
b.
same as a.

a. since the probability of you choosing the correct door is 1/3, it would be 1/3

## Boxes
let E the event that Frida picks from box 1
let !E be the even that Frida pick from box 2
## Balls
let F be the event that Frida picks a blue ball
let !F be the even that Frida picks a red ball
## Probabilities
we want to find Pr(E|F)

Pr(F|E)=3/5, since 3/5 balls match in the 1st box
Pr(F|!E)=1/5, since 1/5 balls match in the 2nd box

Pr(F)=4/10 since 4 balls out of 10 total
Pr(!F)=6/10

we then insert and have
$$Pr(E|F)=\frac{Pr(F|E)*Pr(E)}{Pr(F|E)*Pr(E)+pr(F|!E)*Pr(!E)}=\frac{\frac{3}{5}*\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}{\frac{3}{5}*\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{5}*\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}=\frac{3}{4}$$

true positive is 98

a. find the probability that someone who tests negative on opium gets correctly addressed.
F=5% tests negattive
!F=95% tests positive
E = people who does not opium is 99%
!E = 1%

pr(F|E)=
p(E|F)=

a. 
Largest = p(B) since have intersection
smallest = $$\frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{2}$$
since we have one of the probabilities being > 0.5, we will always have some intersection

b.  
largest = 1 if they have as little commons as possible
smallest = the smallest i can be is if B is inside of A, then we dont gain anything by the union and end up with `p(A)`

![[Pasted image 20230925131257.png]]
$$p(B|A)=\frac{p(A\cap B)}{p(A)}$$
$$\frac{p(A\cap B)}{p(A)}<p(B)$$

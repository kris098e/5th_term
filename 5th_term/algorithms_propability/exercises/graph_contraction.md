it is 1
- can make induction proof, base case will have 1. with $n+1$ vertices it will still hold that all cults will be a minimum cut

First only $n-1$ edges are good, out of the $n$ edges. Then $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$ are good ...
$$\frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{n-2}{n-1}\cdot\dots \frac{2}{3}=\frac{(n-1)!}{\frac{n!}{2}}=\frac{2(n-1)!}{n!}=\frac{2}{n}$$

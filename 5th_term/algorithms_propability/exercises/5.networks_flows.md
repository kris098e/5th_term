- to go to `N` we can just remove `A, B`. Since this will just be the balance to the s' to a possitive, instead of having flow balance.
- to go to `N'` we can just introduce `A, B` again.

The proof that the flow of N' and N is just looking at the cut, that it has the same flow

- We set the capacity to $\infty$ of `C(A,s)` is because we don't really care about the capacity, it is controlled by the `s's` where you cannot change their flows.

the main point is that we should not go through the path.
- The main part is that `u` cannot provide flow to `t`, so it should not be sent to.

## case1: s cannot go to u
can draw the scenario.

if `s` cannot reach `u`, and there always exists a path from `s to t` => `t` cannot go to `u`, else `s` would be able to to go `u`
## case2: u cannot go to t
vice versa. If s can reach u but you cannot reach t from u, then we should skip the path to u, as it will not provide anything to the flow.

- to go to `N` we can just remove `A, B`. Since this will just be the balance to the s' to a possitive, instead of having flow balance.
- to go to `N'` we can just introduce `A, B` again.

The proof that the flow of N' and N is just looking at the cut, that it has the same flow

- We set the capacity to $\infty$ of `C(A,s)` is because we don't really care about the capacity, it is controlled by the `s's` where you cannot change their flows.

the main point is that we should not go through the path.
- The main part is that `u` cannot provide flow to `t`, so it should not be sent to.

## case1: s cannot go to u
can draw the scenario.

if `s` cannot reach `u`, and there always exists a path from `s to t` => `t` cannot go to `u`, else `s` would be able to to go `u`
## case2: u cannot go to t
vice versa. If s can reach u but you cannot reach t from u, then we should skip the path to u, as it will not provide anything to the flow.

- source is home
- t is school
have some arcs going out which are streets you can walk on from the house
`if we have a max flow of 2 or more, then it is possible`
`if we have 1 or 0, then the children have to walk on the same street` which we don't want

each vertex will be converted to two vertices. The capacity of the arc between the two created vertices will then the limit of `v` $l(v)$. The number of vertices will be $2 \mid V\mid$, and number of edges $\mid V\mid+\mid E\mid$

Breadth first search in the residual network and then augment with the smallest capacity

Max flow is `12+7+4`. This can be seen my also making a cut over the edges from 
- v4 to v3
- v4 to t
- v1 to v3

given any maximal flow, we have to show there are $\mid E\mid$ augmenting paths.

- all flows can be decomposed into $O(m+n)$ path and cycle flow. n=#vertices and m=#edges.
- at most `m` of which are cycles

- increase the capacities of all arcs by some value $R$. This will add a lot of capacity to the cuts where there are many edges. But this will not preserve the min-cut as you will punish very hard

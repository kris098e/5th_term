# Important notes
look at the `notes to proof`-section
Remember the reason we do $s_{0}-s_{1}+s_{2}-s_{3}\dots$, is because we have the space, we then remove the once where `1 condition holds`, now since we have removed more than we should (because we **overcounted**) we add the stuff we overcounted again.

## Notes to the proof
- See first that, in the `2nd step`, we used the corollary, which let us rewrite the expression so that it will be equal to `0`. 
- Next we isolate the `C(r,0)` which ends up concluding that the `1st` equation is `=1`.
	- Do keep an eye out for the $(-1)^{r}$ and $(-1)^{r+1}$, as these are used differently in the different equations. 
This concludes that each element `a` is counted once, which means that all elements are counted once by the equation.

# Examples
include
1. lower and upper bound of the choose with replica
	1. This include first pushing the lower bound to be 0, i.e define some `x1', x2', ...`, then make the universe for the example, i.e all which satisfies just the lower bound. Then make calculations where the negated condition is met for all of the x-primes. Then where two of these conditions are met...

2. prime numbers
	1. This involves taking all the primes in `0-sqrt(n)`, then where one condition is met, e.g how many are divisible by 2, then 3, then 5... Next up, how many are divisible by 3 and 2, 2 and 5 ... Then where 3 conditions are met, then 4... T
	2. this will effectively eliminate all of the numbers which are divisible by the prime numbers in the range `0-sqrt(n)`. Then we have found the final count, we just subtract all of the numbers from `2-100`, since `1` is not a prime number we dont care about it, which are not prime, and find how many numbers between `2-100` which are prime.
**In this example she forgot to include the 4 prime numbers which are using, i.e `2,3,5,7`, so the amount of prime numbers should be added with 4.**

# Number of onto-functions
![[Pasted image 20230928164329.png]]
The number of functions in this example is $3^6$ since, for each of the elements being mapped via the function, i.e the x's in `f(x)`, can each go to 3 options. Meaning we have $3^6$ functions.
- S1: we have $2^6$ options, and we can choose the element which is not mapped to in  $3\choose 1$ ways.
- S2: we have $1^6$ options, and we can choose the elements to exclude in $3\choose 2$ ways.

# Derangements
This comes down to that not one object gets into the correct spot. In most examples we see the clothing problem in the theaters.

The example below will have 10 clothing, and find the number of ways we can arrange the clothing such that no person get their correct clothing. We can do this by taking the entire space, i.e `10!`, and then do **inclusion/exclusion**. In this fashion, we can look at how many times we can choose `1 out of 10` to get the correct hat, which is ${10 \choose 1}9!$ as we can select the first hat in so many ways, then we can choose ${10 \choose 2}8!$ as we have to choose 2, lock these in and we have `8!` for the rest of the clothing.

# Pigeon hole principle
In these problems it all comes down to identifying what are the "pigeons" and what are the "pigeon holes"

Can prove that lossless compression is not possible. Fx here we have $2^n$ inputs and $2^m$ outputs, there are a lot more inputs than outputs, meaning that two inputs must match a given output, and therefore the output cannot cover all of the $2^n$ inputs.

# Permutations & combinations
## Permutations
Ordered set of a given set. Can also be a r-permutation meaning that we are interresed in a paring of the set but only with `r` of the members
Has mostly to do with `!` i.e **factorial**
## Combinations
Unordered set of a given set

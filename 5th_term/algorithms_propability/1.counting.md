# Pigeon hole principle
In these problems it all comes down to identifying what are the "pigeons" and what are the "pigeon holes"
![[Pasted image 20230903152857.png]]
Can prove that lossless compression is not possible. Fx here we have $2^n$ inputs and $2^m$ outputs, there are a lot more inputs than outputs, meaning that two inputs must match a given output, and therefore the output cannot cover all of the $2^n$ inputs.

## Covered examples
**Ramseys theorem**
group of 6 people, each pair of individuals contains 2 enemies or 2 friends, there are now 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies, when we pick a person out. This follows from the generalized pigeon hole principle $\lceil \frac{n}{\#groups}\rceil=\lceil \frac{5}{2}\rceil=3$. Meaning that there must be at least 4 friends or 4 enemies.
# Permutations & combinations

## Permutations
Ordered set of a given set. Can also be a r-permutation meaning that we are interresed in a paring of the set but only with `r` of the members
Has mostly to do with `!` i.e **factorial**
## Combinations
Unordered set of a given set

The reason this is true is because if we look at the formula, when doing the computation, only the placement of the two factorials in the denominator changes,

example: `C(7,3) = C(7,4)`
`C(7,3)=7/(3!*4!)`
`C(7,4)=7/(4!*3!)`
### Binomial coefficients

It follows the coeefficients of the calculations of $(x+y)^n$ as seen in the video
It is based on how many ways there are to choose the specific combination, fx choosing $n=4$ there are 6 ways to choose the combination $x^2y^2$

### Vandermonde
![[Pasted image 20230907112542.png]]
Think about it as we want exactly r, and if we chose `k` from `n` then we need only choose `r-k` in m. We iterate over the combinations where we fx choose more from `m` than `n`
## Generalized Permutations and combinations
### permutations with repetitions

When you have repetitions you can just divide by the number of ways to arrange the duplicates, as you want to get rid of all the arrangements you cannot tell apart. I.e when we fx have 3L's, we have to divide by the number of ways to arrange these L's as we cannot tell them apart.Because these are the number of ways to arrange them when they are together. Meaning, we know there are 3 possible Ls to the first L and 2 for the next and 1 for the next, we remove these permutations where the Ls are in the same place in the permutation, since we do not know which is which. fx we remove 1 of these `KLELLY, KLELLY` since we dont know which Ls are which

### Combinations with repetition

![[Pasted image 20230910120729.png]]
What we are doing is that when we take an item into the list, we put it back in. Meaning that we will actually, in the case where we choose the same object `r`-times, we end up with having `n+r-1` objects to choose from instead. `r-1` since the first time we take it, it is already contained inside of `n`.

In this example we have `n=3`, i.e we have to distinguish between `3` different kinds of objects. We only need `2` seperators to do so, or `2` bars, meaning we effectively have to choose `2+7` different objects to place, since we just add the new objects, which acts as separators.

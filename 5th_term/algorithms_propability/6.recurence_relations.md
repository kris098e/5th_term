## better to define functions, since then we dont have calculate the terms before it.
Try looking at how the expressions increments.

Here we are talking about pairs. In the first month we have 1 young couple. These dont get ready to reproduce before month 3, but hey will then produce another pair. In month 4 they produce another pair, and these are not ready to reproduce. In month 5 one of the pairs became ready to pair, so we have the young which were not ready to ready to reproduce, plus 2 new.
## tower of hanoi
We come up with the recursive definition by looking at the number of times we have to move the brick on top, to get the lower one correctly set. 
This is, if we have 1, we just have to move it to `2`. If we have another one on top of it, we have to move it twice, since we have to move it to tower `3`, move the biggest one on the bottom to `2` and then the smaller one to `3`. Now this continues for each. 
We have to move double the last disks to move the biggest disk to where it has to go, and then we have to move that big disk, which is the `+1`

In this equation, we use the geometric sequence, where `a1` is the start state, which is `1` and `r` is the recurring number. We end up simplifying it, getting it reduced.

This works since, for 
- n-1
	- all that works, we can add a 1 to it, which wont break anything
- n-2
	- all that works, we add a 10 to it, which wont break anything
By doing i recursively we know that the previous ones does not break the rules, and we add all of the possibilities, which ensures we wont break any rules.

## Notes after recap
Its all about assuming that you can write up $a_{n}=r^{n}$. That is $r^{n}=c_{1}r^{n-1}+c_{2}r^{n-2} + \cdots$ Then we can for degree `k=2` we have the equation $r^{n}=c_{1}r^{n-1}+c_{2}r^{n-2}$, where we can divide by $r^{n-2}$ and get $r^{2}=c_{1}r^{n-1}+c_{2}$. now $r^{2}-c_{1}r-c_{2}=0$
Next we want to prove the theorem that
$a_{n}=\alpha_{1}r_{1}^{n}+\alpha_{2}r_{2}^{n}$
This is a matter of writing the $a_{n}=c_{1}r^{n-1}+c_{2}r^{n-2}$ now using that $r^{n-1}=\alpha_{1} r_1^{n-1}+\alpha_{2}r^{n-2}$ and using that $r^{2}=c_{1}r^{n-1}+c_{2}$. Then we can do the calculations which will end up giving us the equation for the alphas.
we now, given $a_{0}=C_{0}$ and $a_{1}=C_{1}$, we can write up the equations
$$a_{0}=\alpha_{1}r^{0}+\alpha_{2}r^{0}=\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}$$
$$a_{1}=\alpha_{1}r^{1}+\alpha_{2}r^{1}$$
Where we can find the alphas by isolating them.
**Inhomogenoues**: The solution must differ by some solution to the function part each time, and as we have proved that a solution + another solution, is also a solution, then we can just find a solution to both, and subtract the solution to the function part?
# Notes to Rosen 8.2
Only depend on the last `k` results

Important to note, that we assume it must hold that $a_{n}=r^n$ so it must hold for all the previous a's

> Notice, that if we have some term with only relying on 1 previous its easy, but to solve where two terms is harder, but there are formulas to this. But then when it comes to 3 and more, it becomes very hard

	**This just shows that any linear combinations of solutions can be combined**

**See how the the characteristic equation was derived again if need clarity**
![[Pasted image 20231012115113.png]]
it says `because triangle`
could add as a last `=` that it is simply equal to $a_{n}$.

Important to note that $a_{0}=C_{0}$ i.e, it is not the small c constant.
![[Pasted image 20231012115742.png]]
The idea of solving for alpha1 fx is, that if we want to get alpha1 we want to make the term $\alpha_{2}r_{2}$ disappear, so we multiply by $r_{2}$ to $C_{0}$ which will then end up cancelling that term out, now we can isolate in the rest, where the 2nd side $\alpha_{1}r_{1}-\alpha_{1}r_{2}=\alpha_{1}(r_{1}-r_{2})$ and then just isolate $\alpha_{1}$.
**what we do is we subtract $C_{1}-C_{0}r_{2}$**

And these solutions are unique to the given conditions that $a_{0}, a_{1}$ has to be some values

## inhomogeneous recurrence relations (has function of n)
Dont really have a clue what it should follow that we can say that this is correct, but the calculations are easy enough

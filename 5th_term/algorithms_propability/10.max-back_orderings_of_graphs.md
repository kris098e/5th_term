# Intro
ordering of $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\dots v_{i}$
The first one will be the one with the most edges. When taking this out, you will have to update your other vertices and reorder. can use a `heap`.
## edge connectivity
can start by taking out the vertex with the most edges and make a guess that this will be the $\lambda(G)$ But this is the maximum, so when reordering, and taking the next vertex out then this will be equal or less, so we will continue to do this until we reach the vertex with the lowest amount of edges to the others and return this as the vertex `x`.
Remember when we take out the vertex, we also have to adjust all of the vertices which had an edge to the vertex, meaning they will all have their weight reduced by at least `1`

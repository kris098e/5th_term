The interpreta- tion that we give to this notation is that if we start the execution of ¢ in the state o, the execution terminates (in a single step) with state 7. For example, the transition which defines the skip command is (skip, o) — 0. It can be seen that we have a command that does nothing. Starting in any state, o, skip terminates leaving the state unchanged. In more complex cases, a terminal situation will be reached not in a single large step, but rather in many little steps which progressively transform the state (starting with o); the command, c, is progressively executed a part at a time until the whole has been “consumed”. These little steps are expressed by transitions of the form: (c,o) = (c'0”). For example, one of the transitions which define the conditional command will be: (if tt then ¢ else ¢, 0) — (c1, 0),","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}

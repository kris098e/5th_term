Message passing is useful for exchanging smaller amounts of data, because no conflicts need be avoided. Message pass- ing is also easier to implement in a distributed system than shared memory. (Although there are systems that provide distributed shared memory, we do not consider themin this text.) Shared memory can be faster than message pass- ing, since message-passing systems are typically implemented using system calls and thus require the more time-consuming task of kernel intervention. In shared-memory systems, system calls are required only to establish shared- memory regions. Once shared memory is established, all accesses are treated as routine memory accesses, and no assistance from the kernel is required. In Section 3.5 and Section 3.6 we explore shared-memory and message- passing systems in more detail.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}

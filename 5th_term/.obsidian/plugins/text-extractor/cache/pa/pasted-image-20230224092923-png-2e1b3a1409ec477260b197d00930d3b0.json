(a) Load python packages: scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn, pandas, TSNE from sklearn.manifold, and load-digits dataset from sklearn.datasets. (b) Load dataset and print dataset keys. Assign data as x and target as y, then investigate the shapes of the data. (c) Define and fit the model by using the TSNE class. (d) Generate dataframe and plot the data.","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"eng","hash":"","size":0}

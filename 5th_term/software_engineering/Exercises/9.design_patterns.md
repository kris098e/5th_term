# 1 Observer pattern
We now need to enhance our Parking Lot class with some new electronic signs that shows how many vacant parking lots we currently have.

For the fun of it we are going to use the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) .

You need to:
- Be able to register and de-register observers
- Notify observers on cars arriving
- Notify observers on cars leaving
# 2 Code Smells
Generate a server in a programming language of your choice from your Swagger Definition.

Read through the code and find examples of:

- Code smells
	- no break in lines, very long lines.
	- bad indentation
```java
@Schema(example = "10", description = "") // could use better code description
```
- Hard to read code
- Naming gone wrong
	- has the same name for different operations distinguished on parameters. Could be named differently
- Is it consistent in way of working?

What level of Richardson Maturity Model is the generated code?
- level 2

# 3 Design Patterns
Pick a GoF Design Pattern and implement an example of the pattern. Make sure you know exactly what is the Design Pattern, and what is the problem domain.

# 4 Cyclomatic Complexity
Calculate the Cyclomatic Complexity for your Java implementation of Parking Lots. Is all the methods below 10 in score? If not, refactor until below 10.

When/If your methods are already below 10 in complexity score:

- Is 10 still an OK boundary? Should it be higher? Should it be lower?
- Create a method with complexity 5, 10 and 20. Any patterns?
- Is the Cyclomatic Complexity language specfic? Could we allow for 20 in one language and only 5 in another? Why? Why not?
**each branch in the code will increase the cyclomatic complexity by 1**
# 5 Cargo-Cult
Investigate the Cargo-Cult and why this is relevant to both Programming and Software Processes.

**cargo cult is about doing something where you dont really understand why. Fx in the programming, if a type is not nullable and you dont understand the language, then you might still check for nullability, comment on self-explanatory code, calling `.toList()` even tho it is already a list.**
- **most of all, fx if using agile and scrum, enforcing the behaviour without even knowing what it really does and why you should use it. Maybe something else is better for you**

- Why did they behave as they did?
Because they did not know any better, conclusion was essentially random
- Why is this a great example of “Doing Agile vs. Being Agile”?
	- Cargo-cult is doing Agile where you learn new things, but dont  bother understanding it.
		- The cult did not understand what it was, they just **did something** and hope it was they thought
	- If they were agile they would wonder about what it was and dont come up with conclusions before they were certain. They continue to improve, instead of being stuck
![[Pasted image 20231108090839.png]]
- Why is this relevant in programming?
Already explained, somewhat doing the understanding of some coding principle, and then just stop there with the incorrect conclusion or no real conclusion at all.
## Chatten
Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. This is often symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were trying to solve or the apparent solution. The term may apply when anyone inexperienced with the problem at hand copies some program code from one place to another with little understanding of how it works or whether it is required [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

Cargo cult programming can also refer to the practice of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle. Some examples are adding unnecessary comments to self-explanatory code, overzealous adherence to the conventions of a programming paradigm, or adding deletion code for objects that garbage collection automatically collects [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

In software engineering, a related term is cargo cult software engineering, coined by Steve McConnell. This term describes software development organizations that attempt to emulate more successful development houses, either by slavishly following a software development process without understanding the reasoning behind it, or by attempting to emulate a commitment-oriented development approach by mandating long hours and unpaid overtime, while in successful companies these might instead be consequences of high motivation instead of causes of success [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

Here are some examples of cargo cult programming in C#:

1. **Checking a Non-Nullable Value Type for Null**: This is a common mistake made by developers who don't understand the difference between value and reference types. The compiler will warn you about this, indicating a lack of understanding [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).

```java
public Product Find(int id)
{
   if (id != null) // this check is useless
   {
       Console.WriteLine("This line will always get reached.");
   }

   return new Product();
}
```

2. **Unnecessary Use of ToList() in LINQ to Object Queries**: Developers who don't understand the nature of LINQ might erroneously think that the LINQ methods belong to the concrete type List\<T> instead of being extension methods that can be used with any IEnumerable\<T> implementation [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).
```java
var result = users.ToList()
.Where(x => x.PremiumUser)
.ToList()
.Select(x => new { Name = x.Name, Birth = x.DateOfBirth })
.ToList();
```


3. **Unnecessary Conversions**: Developers might create unnecessary conversions when a simple cast would have sufficed [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).


4. **Try-Catch Everywhere**: This anti-pattern is when a developer adds a try-catch block to every single line that could possibly throw an exception. This blurs the distinction between expected and unexpected errors [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).

5. **Using StringBuilder Everywhere**: After reading somewhere that concatenating strings by using the '+' operator is incredibly inefficient, some developers take it upon themselves to update every single concatenation in the codebase to StringBuilder. However, unnecessary code changes are expensive and dangerous; don’t make performance-based changes unless you’ve identified a performance problem [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).

To avoid cargo cult programming, developers can use code review/pair programming, always test their hypothesis, read other people's code, and learn from their tools [blog.ndepend.com](https://blog.ndepend.com/cargo-cult-programming/).

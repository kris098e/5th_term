- What did you answer correctly?
- What questions did you not answer correctly?

# 2 Houston, We Have a Problem
Using the Houston Matrix, what kind of process design would you recommend for a an online ticketing system? What if the system must integrate with Facebook? What if it mush integrate with three big banks and the tax authorities?
## Online ticketing system
not so complex, nor uncertainty. However it has some, and therefore it  must a be a dog
## integrate with facebook
becomes more complex and more uncertain, but overall a lot more complex, ending with a cow
## Integrate with banks and authorities
then we will end up in the bull area, since there are a lot more partners, each with requirements
# 3 Stakeholder Salience
You are to implement an IT system for handling loan applications in a big bank.

The system must be able to process loan applications.

The potential customer fills out an application online. This application then gets screened by an financial advisor. If any questions arise the case gets bumped to a Supervisor that then takes contact to the potential customer and makes sure everything checks out.

The bank sometime needs to fetch extra information like: Medical Journals, Criminal Records, etc.

At any time the potential customer can view the current status of the appliction online.

If a loan gets approved the bank sends information to the authorities.

- Who are stakeholders in this system? Where do they fit in the Stakeholder Salience model?
	- The applicants/customers
		- core, as these has power aswel since they may boycutt our solution
	- The workers which will use the system
		- dependant
	- The authoritiez as these will have to make to sure it lives to to the standards
		- These are dangerous, they dont care much about the system
- How do you communicate with the stakeholders? Who do you need to keep close? Who can you move further away?
	- authoritiez: direct communication, and detailed about what to do
	- customers: does only need communication whenever they are directed
- Identify at least 5 different Use Cases for at least 3 different Users
#### Financial Advisor (User 1):
1. Fill out initial loan application review.
2. Forward application to Supervisor in case of questions.
#### Supervisor (User 2):
3. Review application escalated by Financial Advisor.
4. Contact potential customer for clarification.
#### Potential Customer (User 3):
5. View application status online.

- Draw a Use Case Diagram for the identified users and Use Cases
Looks like this
![[Pasted image 20231006143319.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231006143752.png]]
- Create a list of functional requirements (headlines are sufficient for now)
	- be able to login 
	- should be able to see the status of the application
	- Be able to forward to suberviser
- Create a list of non-functional requirements
	- response time limit
	- uptime
	- 3rd party system, if they are live or not
	- if dependencies work or not
# 4 Scrum Team
- Is the Product Owner a stakeholder?
	- He is core
- Is the Scrum Master a stakeholder?
	- He is a stakeholder, since he will want the team to work which included the developers and the product owner. He is urgent and legitimate but does not really have any power given he cannot do much about the product
- Are the Developers a stakeholder?
	- legitimate and urgent
# 5 Cynefin and Stakeholders
How can you use Cynefin to optimize the communication to stakeholders depending on where the project is in the Cynefin framework?
## Obvious 
Have more time to do long talks with the stakeholders
## Chaotic
We have no idea on how long time the feature would take
## Complicated
Have an idea of what is going on, and can communicate this
## Complex
Not sure, but can give a little information and try more
# 6 User Stories
## User Stories
- As a User I can Login, so that I can see my Account Details
- As a User I can Logout, so that I can leave the computer
- As a User I can Edit my Account, so that I can update my name, email and personal details
- As a User I can search other Users, so that I can connect with my friends
- As a User I can find similar Users, so that I can find new friends
- As a User I can upload a document and share it with other users, so that we can collaborate on the document
- As a User I can see my list of documents fast, so that I do not leave the page
- As a User I can easily update my profile image, so that I always have a new and good profile picture
- As an Admin I can monitor the system to make sure everything works
- As an Admin I can see the current system load for each of the servers, so that I can see if we are on top of performance
- As an Admin I can delete users, to keep the user database clean
- As an Admin I can manage the application, to make sure we are GDPR compliant Use the User Stories above.

For each of these examples:

- Do they all follow the User Story template?
	- Yes, but some are vague
- Would you be able to start implementing the feature only given the User Stories? Why? Why not?
	- If the user story does not really state definitaly what want to happen, then it will be hard to implement right away. Fx "everything works" - we dont specify `what is everything`
- Is anything implied in the stories?
	- Different levels, fx `admin, user` so that is implication. Implied that users are connected in some way, as users needs to find users.
	- also implied that the users already have their account, as their is no account creation story
- Rewrite or refine the story by adding Acceptance Criteria and dependencies?

# 8 SMART Goals or User Stories?
- When would you use SMART Goals instead of User Stories? Or would you always use SMART Goals?
	- Since you can put more details into the task, but in the user stories you can always make a little but more on the fly and refine them later
- Does a backlog have to be made of User Stories?
	- No it would be stupid to bind yourself in this way, SMART goals should be a more refined user story

# 9 Non-Functional Requirements
- Identify the Non-Functional Requirements in the list of User Stories
- Are they precise?
- Can we validate them with little to no room for interpretation?
- Write 5 examples of Non-Functional Requirements as “free-text”
- Give the NFR’s to another group and have them reformulate them as User Stories

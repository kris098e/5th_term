# 1 Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics
Go trough the [10 Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and come up with 1 example per heuristic.
## Answer
Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design, often referred to as "heuristics", are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. They have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994. Here are examples for each heuristic:

1. **Visibility of system status**: A good example is the status bar at the bottom of many applications. It provides immediate feedback about the system's status, such as whether it's loading, saving, or ready for interaction [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

2. **Match between system and the real world**: An example is a weather app that uses icons to represent different weather conditions. This helps users understand the weather at a glance [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

3. **User control and freedom**: In a word processor, users have control over their text by being able to select, copy, paste, and delete it. They also have the freedom to undo and redo actions [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

4. **Consistency and standards**: This is demonstrated by the use of a shopping cart icon to represent items in a shopping cart across different websites. Users expect to see this icon and understand that it represents their selected items [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

5. **Error prevention**: An example is a form that checks for valid email format before submission. If the user enters an invalid email, the form will not allow the submission and will display an error message [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

6. **Recognition rather than recall**: This is shown in a navigation menu that keeps important information visible on the screen, reducing the burden on users' short-term memory [2](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/).

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: An example is a text editor that provides keyboard shortcuts for commonly used commands. This speeds up the interaction for expert users while still being accessible for novice users [9](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flexibility-efficiency-heuristic/).

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: A website that uses a clean, uncluttered design with a limited color palette and straightforward navigation can be considered an example of this heuristic [2](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/).

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: An example is a website that provides clear error messages when a user tries to perform an action that fails, such as entering an invalid password [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

10. **Help and documentation**: A user manual or help guide that provides step-by-step instructions for common tasks can be considered an example of this heuristic [1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
# 2 Low Fidelity Prototype
Grap a piece of paper and a pen and create a low fidelity prototype for an app that enables people to find nearby vending machines.

# 3 High Fidelity Prototype
Look at one of the tools (Figma, InVision, PowerPoint) and create the first steps towards a high fidelity prototype that suggests new restaurents depending on some different parameters like: Price, cuisine, distance, …

The prototype has to have at least one animation

# 4 Fake Doors
Regan mentioned Fake Door Prototype. Find examples of Fake Doors and how people have used them.

What is the benefit of Fake Doors? Any downsides?
- fx show a button to say `try new features`, and then dont do anything but say `thanks for showing interest` to get **data**
# 5 UI vs UX
How would you describe the difference between UI and UX?
- User Interface: does it look nice?
- User Experience: does it feel good to use? Does it follow Jacob Nielsens 10 heuristics
# 6 Product Fail
In the article on [Product Fail by Marty Cagan](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/) he creates a list of 10 things that happens.

- 1: What type of stakeholder would you expect to be present here (using the Stakeholder Salience model)?
- 2: Imagine you are asked to create a business case for a smaller feature that you would estimate takes 2 developers 2 weeks to implement. What strategies could you use to say no to the business case ask?
- 3: Marty talks about “time to money”. What does that mean?
- 4: How does bullet point 4 fit with the Agile Principles?
- 5: Why does Marty call out UX here in particular? Why do we need to call out UX?
- 6: Marty states that: “The little secret in product is that engineers are typically the best single source of innovation”. Why is that the case?
- 7: What is the last 80% Marty is refering to?
- 8: How did the Spotify model try to “fix” the problem with “orphaned projects”
- 9: Can you build up an argument for this using Cynefin?
- 10: How does the “Sunk Cost Fallacy” fit into this argument?

## Answer
- **Source of Ideas**:
    - _Stakeholder Salience_: Core stakeholders (high power, high legitimacy, high urgency) are evident. They include executives and key stakeholders whose ideas drive the product direction. This model often neglects the voice of less dominant but crucial stakeholders like end-users or frontline employees.
- **Business Cases**:
    - _Strategy to Say No_: Emphasize the uncertainty in estimating potential returns and costs at this early stage. Advocate for a more iterative, customer-focused approach that allows for learning and adaptation over rigid planning based on speculative data​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/)​.
- **Time to Money**:
    - _Meaning_: It refers to the duration it takes from conceptualizing an idea to the point where it begins to generate business value. This includes several iterations and refinements of the idea​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/#:~:text=If%20that%E2%80%99s%20not%20bad%20enough%2C,%E2%80%9D)​.
- **Role of Product Management**:
    - _Agile Principles_: This approach, focusing on requirement gathering and documentation, `contrasts` with Agile principles. Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change over following a plan​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/)​.
- **Role of Design (UX)**:
    - _Importance of UX_: UX is crucial as it directly impacts user satisfaction and product usability. Cagan points out that in the flawed model, UX input is sought too late, limiting its potential impact on the product's success​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/)​.
- **Engineers as Innovators**:
    - _Reason for Innovation Source_: Engineers are often closest to the technology and its possibilities. Their early involvement can lead to more innovative solutions, but they are frequently brought in too late in the flawed process​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/)​.
- **The Last 80%**:
    - _Explanation_: When only 20% of the the orginisation is using Agile methods, we miss out on 80% of the benefits, since the delevopers only have the roadmap to implement which was given by the `core` management. This simplifies to using a waterfall model / planning model for preparing the plan and then the developers uses agile.
- **Orphaned Projects in the Spotify Model**:
    - _Spotify's Solution_: Spotify's model aims to address this by organizing teams into autonomous squads focused on specific features or areas, allowing for more ownership and continuous development, reducing the chance of projects becoming orphaned​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/). It is just like the scrum teams have responsibility of the features.
- **Cynefin Framework Argument**:
    - _Application_: The Cynefin framework, which helps leaders understand challenges and apply appropriate problem-solving approaches, could argue for a more complex, less linear approach to product development than the traditional Waterfall model. The waterfall model can be used for simple and sometimes complicated. But agile handles better the complex and complicated domains, as it is iterative.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**:
    - _Relation to Argument_: The Sunk Cost Fallacy, where past investments in a project are used to justify ongoing investment despite poor prospects, is a pitfall in the process described by Cagan. It leads to continuing on failing projects due to prior investments rather than re-evaluating based on current understanding​[](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/#:~:text=10,that%20time%20or%20money%20back)​.

# 1: Old-School Project Manager

Imagine you’re starting a new job, and you really want to show that you know your Software Engineering Process stuff.

You are going to work on a project and you feel that the process designed does not fit the IT development way of working. The Project Manager is a bit old-school and absolutely loves stage-gate models to ensure a steady progress. The project is a multi-year project with a huge set of requirements and little interaction from the stakeholders.

The system you are developing is an online platform for creating online communities in areas struck by natural disaster. You are working with both NGO, Governments, volunteers, and some of these have conflicting requirements for the system. Furthermore, given the use of the system, you never know when a next testing opportunity arises.

- How would you structure the process if you didn’t need to care for the process in place?
	- Scrum/agile
- What would this require from your stakeholders?
	- More interractions or settle on a contract to be more secure. Then we can do plan
- How would you convince the Project Manager your process is better suited for this project?
	- Introduce him to the cynefin model, and that the project is in the complex domain, so we need to be able to act quickly on requirements when they do speak up.
- This system is also going to be used in areas where there is active (civil) war going on. Does this influence the stakeholder classification?
	- Yes it does, since fx the government will be a lot more dangerous to the project
	- There may come more stakeholders, fx some rebels, one side of the war

# 2: Scrum For Evening News
Imagine you’re heading up a news desk as the executive producer. You are responsible for making sure that your news show airs every night at 18:00 with the most relevant stories from your city.

- How would you use Scrum for this?
	- sprint each day
	- each of the news-story will have one epic each and have some tasks for them
	- the executive producer will be acting as the PO and may also act as the scrum master, asking if everything is up to date.
- What would the sprint length be?
	- 1 day
- Who would do what? What ceremonies (fx planning, demo review) would you use?
	- planning (what should be covered)
	- review (demo/sending the broadcast)
	- retro (be a micro meet after the broadcast)
	- daily scrum (ask if we will make it, other updates. Middle of the day)

(Side note: This was actually done during the Arab Spring by some broadcasting companies)
# 3: Estimation
Imagine you were going to implement 5 stories. We then need to estimate them, we will try different methods.

Pick 5 stories from last week. Pick one story that you believe is somewhere in the middle. We will denote this as our _baseline_.

- As a User I can Login, so that I can see my Account Details (medium, 5)
- As a User I can Logout, so that I can leave the computer (easy, 1)
- As a User I can Edit my Account, so that I can update my name, email and personal details (easy, 2)
- As a User I can search other Users, so that I can connect with my friends (hard, 8. Because is uncertain of the values)
- As a User I can find similar Users, so that I can find new friends (hard, 13. Similar users may result in some machine learning models)

## Poker Planning

For each of the stories play Poker Planning: Does it require more effort than the baseline? How much?

When you have estimated all of the stories, did the baseline change along the way?

You can use this website: [https://scrumpoker.online](https://scrumpoker.online/)

## T-Shirt Sizes
For the T-Shirt Sizes we will use: Extra Small (XS), Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L) and Extra Large (XL).

Before we start: Based on the Poker Planning, do you need to change the baseline story? Or use the same? Assign the baseline story an M. Take turns assigning a size to a story.
## Differences?

- What differences did you notice? What did you like the most and why?
	- poker plan more discussion based, but will result in better results as less impact
	- May also be good to interract with each other and have som talks 
- When will one work better than the other one?
	- poker plan will work better when more disagreement, as start out will all opinions. Also when we there more time
	- just discussing it is more time efficient  and may work better if you are more alligned.
- Is there a difference in if you were in the same room, or online?
	- online may be more controlled, as you can fx raise your hands and have queues, where in the same room may be more chaotic

# 4: INVEST
- As a User I can Login, so that I can see my Account Details (medium, 5)
Take the same five stories, do they live up to the INVEST criteria?

- Independant
	- assumes you can create an account
- Negotiable
	- yes it is, as you can implement in a lot of ways
- Valuable
	- Depends on how important the account details are
- Estimateable
	- yes you can estimate how long it will take to make the login details, make the page for account details and the fetching of the account details
- Small
	- Yes it is small enough to be a task and can be done in a sprint
- Testable
	- can you login and see your account details

# 5: Scrum
Devise 5 steps you would take to start up a new team and project using Scrum as the way of working.

Where would you start? What should you be aware of

Starting up a new team and project using Scrum as the way of working involves careful planning and execution. Here are five steps to help you get started:

1. **Define the Project and Product Vision:**
    
    - Start by clearly defining the project's objectives and product vision. What problem will the product solve, and who are the target users or customers? Ensure that everyone on the team understands the project's purpose and goals.
2. **Assemble the Scrum Team:**
    
    - Identify and assemble a cross-functional Scrum team. This typically includes a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. Each member should have the necessary skills and expertise to contribute to the project.
3. **Establish the Product Backlog:**
    
    - The Product Owner should create and prioritize a Product Backlog, which is a list of all the features, user stories, and tasks required to achieve the project's goals. The backlog should be dynamic and continuously updated.
4. **Hold Sprint Planning and Daily Standup Meetings:**
    
    - Start with Sprint Planning, where the team selects a set of items from the Product Backlog for the upcoming Sprint (a time-boxed period for development, typically 2-4 weeks). The team plans how they will complete these items.
    - Conduct daily Scrum meetings to keep the team aligned and address any impediments. Each member should share their progress and concerns.
5. **Monitor and Adapt:**
    
    - Throughout the project, track progress using burndown charts or other relevant metrics. Review the work completed in each Sprint during Sprint Review meetings.
    - After each Sprint, hold a Sprint Retrospective to discuss what went well and what could be improved in the team's process.
    - Be flexible and open to change. Scrum encourages adaptation and continuous improvement. Use feedback from team members and stakeholders to refine your processes.

**Things to be aware of:**

1. **Training and Education:** Ensure that the team members and stakeholders understand Scrum principles and practices. Training may be necessary for those new to Scrum.
    
2. **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly define the roles of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, and ensure everyone understands their responsibilities.
    
3. **Communication:** Effective communication is essential in Scrum. Encourage open and transparent communication within the team and with stakeholders.
    
4. **Time Management:** Scrum emphasizes time-boxed activities, so be diligent about adhering to time limits for Sprints, meetings, and other Scrum events.
    
5. **Prioritization:** The Product Owner plays a crucial role in prioritizing the Product Backlog. Make sure the most valuable items are at the top of the backlog.
    
6. **Adaptation:** Scrum is based on empirical process control, meaning that you should be ready to adapt and change as needed based on regular feedback and inspection of your processes.
    
7. **Tools and Technology:** Select and implement tools for managing the Product Backlog, tracking progress, and facilitating communication within the team.
    
By following these steps and being aware of the key considerations, you can successfully start up a new Scrum team and project, fostering an environment of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.

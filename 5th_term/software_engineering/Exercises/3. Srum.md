# 1 Agile Principles
Pick one of the 12 Principles and find some examples of this being applied in practice.

_Working software is the best indicator of progress_, fx looking at a building, and seeing how far it has come in the process. It is easy to see, instead of seeing the documentation on the finished project.
# 2 Minimum Viable Product
If you were to design an investment platform where people could make a monthly payment that is then invested, and a small percentage is paid to our platform, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) would be a critical first step to test our concept and gather feedback.

## MVP Components
- User registration and authentication.
- Payment processing functionality.
- Basic investment mechanism.
- User interface with visual indicators of the percentage we plan to earn.

## User Acquisition and Revenue Generation
To earn money, the MVP needs users who make monthly payments. We should outline strategies for user acquisition, such as marketing campaigns and partnerships. Additionally, the MVP must be equipped to process payments and effectively manage investments to generate revenue.

## Earliest Testable Prototype
The earliest testable prototype would be a video or a visual representation of the platform's user interface. This allows us to gauge initial user interest and collect feedback based on the concept's presentation.

## Earliest Valuable Prototype
The earliest valuable prototype should include:
- User registration and authentication.
- Functional payment processing and investment mechanisms.
- A basic user interface.
This prototype should allow users to make real payments, see their funds invested, and demonstrate our platform's ability to generate revenue. It provides a basic but functional user experience, indicating the platform's potential for success.

# 4 Scrum Accountabilities and Artifacts

Using the Scrum Guide, who (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team, Stakeholders) is then responsible, accountable, consulted and informed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) ) and why for:
1. **Planning**:
    
    - **Responsible**: The Development Team is responsible for estimating the effort required to complete the items in the Product Backlog.
    - **Accountable**: The Product Owner is accountable for prioritizing the items in the Product Backlog and deciding what will be included in the upcoming Sprint.
    - **Consulted**: The Scrum Master may be consulted for guidance and facilitation during the planning process.
    - **Informed**: Stakeholders are informed about the outcomes of the Sprint Planning meeting and the items selected for the Sprint.
2. **Sprints**:
    
    - **Responsible**: The Development Team is responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment during the Sprint.
    - **Accountable**: The Product Owner is accountable for setting the Sprint Goal and making sure the team understands the desired outcome.
    - **Consulted**: The Scrum Master may be consulted for guidance and to help remove any impediments during the Sprint.
    - **Informed**: Stakeholders are informed about the progress of the Sprint through Sprint Reviews and can provide feedback.
3. **Retrospectives**:
    
    - **Responsible**: The Scrum Team, including the Development Team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner, collectively reflects on the Sprint during the Retrospective.
    - **Accountable**: The Scrum Master is accountable for ensuring that the Retrospective takes place and that actions resulting from it are followed up on.
    - **Consulted**: The development team are consulted on how it went
    - **Informed**: Stakeholders may be informed about the outcomes of the Retrospective and any actions taken to improve the process.
4. **Sprint Review**:
    
    - **Responsible**: The Development Team presents the completed work during the Sprint to stakeholders.
    - **Accountable**: The Product Owner is accountable for ensuring that the review takes place, and they may also have a role in deciding whether the work is complete.
    - **Consulted**: The Scrum Master may be consulted for facilitation and guidance during the Sprint Review.
    - **Informed**: Stakeholders are informed about the work completed during the Sprint and can provide feedback.
5. **Daily Standup** (Daily Scrum):
    
    - **Responsible**: Each Development Team member is responsible for reporting their progress and plans for the day during the Daily Standup.
      The scrum master more than the others as the person is responsible for the meetings success
    - **Accountable**: The Development Team collectively is accountable for ensuring that the Daily Standup takes place and that any impediments are addressed.
    - **Consulted**: The Scrum Master may be consulted for assistance in removing impediments or facilitating the Daily Standup if needed.
    - **Informed**: Stakeholders are not typically part of the Daily Standup but may be informed about progress through other means.

# 5 Scrum and Agile Princples
transparancy(share the knowledge and progress), inspection(inspect the ways of working, getting better frequently), adaptation(making changes quickly after inspection)
- Using the three pillars of Scrum and the events, which Agile Principle relates to what Scrum Event, Role or pillar?
## Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Role: developers, stakeholders
- pillar: transparency
- event: review? Showing off what we got
## Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Role: stakeholder(can make new requirements), developers(ready to meet these), PO(ready to take turns in what to do)
- event: Noone
- pillar: adaptation
## Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Role: developers (have to build it), PO(has to plan it)
- Event: somewhat review, as it is here we show the product that we have made in the last sprint
- pillar: inspection (what has been done)
## Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Role: developer, sales
- Event: planning daily
- pillar: transparency(showing progress), adaptation(maybe have to adapt to what they are saying)
## Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- role: all rolesss
- event: none
- pillar: none
## The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Role: PO, developers, scrum master. Have to communicate, stakeholders talk with the PO tho
- event: All of them
- pillar: Transparency
## Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Role: PO, Developers, stakeholders
- event: review
- pillar: inspection
## Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Role: all roles have to be indefinite
- event: all of the events
- pillar: all of them
## Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

## Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

## The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

## At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
- Scrum have some core values. How does these relate to the Agile values and principles?
	- adaptation and costumer collaboration, responding to change
	- Transparency and individuals and interactions. Scrum also has a lot of this inside of it with all the meetings
	- Review and working software
# 6 Sprint Length
## Sprint Length and Methodologies:

The correlation between sprint length and various methodologies like the Houston Matrix, Barry Boehm's Planning Spectrum, and Cynefin can vary based on the specific context and goals of a project. Here's a general overview:

### Houston Matrix:

- The Houston Matrix is a project management tool that helps assess project complexity and uncertainty.
- Sprint length may be influenced by the project's position in the matrix.
- A 1-week sprint could be suitable for projects in the "Simple" or "Complicated" quadrants, where requirements are clear and well-understood.
- A 4-week sprint might align with projects in the "Complex" or "Chaotic" quadrants, where requirements are less clear, and there's a need for more planning and adaptation.

### Barry Boehm's Planning Spectrum:

- Barry Boehm's Planning Spectrum ranges from highly plan-driven (Waterfall) to highly adaptive (Agile).
- A 1-week sprint is more agile and aligns with adaptive approaches like Scrum.
- A 4-week sprint could still be considered agile but may lean slightly more toward the plan-driven end if there's extensive upfront planning.

### Cynefin Framework:

- The Cynefin Framework categorizes problems into domains: Simple, Complicated, Complex, and Chaotic.
- Sprint length can be adjusted based on the problem domain.
- A 1-week sprint might be suitable for addressing issues in the "Simple" or "Complicated" domains.
- A 4-week sprint may align better with the "Complex" domain, where experimentation and adaptation are necessary.

## Sprint Length Comparison:

### 1-Week Sprint vs. 4-Week Sprint:

- A 1-week sprint is typically used for projects with well-defined requirements, a stable team, and a need for rapid feedback and adaptation.
- A 4-week sprint is longer and might be preferred when the project has more complex requirements, larger teams, or longer development cycles.

## Creating a One-Day Sprint:

A one-day sprint is highly unconventional in most Agile frameworks but could be considered in certain situations where extremely rapid development and feedback are required. Here's how it might look:

1. **Quick Planning**: Start the day with a brief planning session. Define a very small and well-understood task or user story.
    
2. **Development**: Developers work intensively on the defined task throughout the day, focusing solely on completing it.
    
3. **Testing**: As development progresses, testing and quality assurance activities are conducted in parallel.
    
4. **Review and Demo**: At the end of the day, the team reviews the work done and demonstrates the completed task to stakeholders.
    
5. **Retrospective**: Conclude the day with a brief retrospective to discuss what went well and what could be improved for future one-day sprints.
    
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Use feedback from the retrospective to refine the process for future one-day sprints.
    

Keep in mind that one-day sprints are best suited for situations where work is extremely well-defined and there's an urgent need for rapid delivery and feedback, such as fixing critical issues or responding to emergencies.
# 7 MVP And Scrum
Must we implement a full MVP in one sprint? Why? Why not?
- depends on what the goal is. If the goal is to only implementing a testable product, then no, otherwise yes
Who decides if the product increment goes into production?
- The product owner, but he/she needs feedback from the development team and stakeholders to know if can, and or should. The PO takes the lead tho.
# 8 Scrum Team
Who is in a Scrum Team?
PO, developers, Scrum master

What accountabilites? What profiles? Stakeholders? Users? Managers?

# 9 “Agile” in Many Organisations
In a semi-plan/semi-agile organisation we have a Project Manager, a Team Lead and a Development Team. Many organisations find especially the Scrum Master role difficult to understand. Why do you think that is the case?
- Because he seems to be a facilitator of nothing, because it can just be done by the development team. But it is a good thing to have someone who can take acountability for following the correct development paths, for continuous improvement, adaptation through the events, and inspection frequently also during the events

- Why is the Scrum Master often depicted with a cap and a whistle?
	- He controls the environment of the team. He facilitates the scrum way of doing things, so he ensures the rules of scrum is adhered, and if not then he will have to take action on the matter
- Why is the Product Owner often depicted with a tie?
	- the PO is responsible of the product, i.e he is the one talking in a business oriented fashion, where you have to look formal

# 10 Plan Orientation, an Elevator Pitch
With the knowledge you have now, create an 5 minutes elevator pitch on why and when to use a Plan Oriented approach.

we should use the plan oriented approach, when the customers has clear definitions, dont want to change product requirement after the contract has been made. Also when the product development will be in the rather complex or chaotic, so more time to figure the best solution is there.

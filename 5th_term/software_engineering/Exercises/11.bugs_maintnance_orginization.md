# 1 “Spotify” Model
Using the “Spotify” Model, describe the following terms:
- Chapter
	- These are groups of people who share the same role or function across different Squads and Tribes. They provide a platform for cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- Tribe
	- Multiple squads together which works on a common item, but each squad may be delegated to a certain feature
- Squad
	- like a scrum team. Have what it takes to make the feature

Why does this models favor trust over control? And Community over structure?
- each squad themselves will have to work automly against a shared goal of the tribe
- Community over structure is because you can share a lot of knowledge between each squads in the tribes. You also have the `chapter` where you can share knowledge via comminuties

How does this model influence their software architecture?
- each of the tribes can themselves choose which tech-stack they may use. But it has to be in some certain guidelines for what they are allowed to use. This may be narrowed down to that squads can themselves choose it.
# 2 Problems with the “Spotify” Model

Using the “#FailedSquadGoals” article, what does that say about the Spotify model? And why?

![[Pasted image 20231123102339.png]]
- Not having to change manager when you switched squads, meant that there would be much chaos and no one would know who managed who. 
- The managers in the teams had people in other squads as well, and other managers had people in the managers squad, meaning that you would have to keep track of a lot which was not doable.

Did they really change the matrix organisation? How does this article try to solve these short commings?
- Tribes are just the matrix orginisation where you form the squads, with what you need.

The article talks about autonomy, what is their view on how the “Spotify” dealt with autonomy?
- The engineers could change squads as they pleased within the tribe, and as long as the squad worked towards a comon goal in the tribe, then everything was good.
	- changing the squads meant a lot of work for the people involved in the process.
# 3 Larman’s Law of Organisational Behavior
How does the “#FailedSquadGoals”, The “Spotify” model and Larman’s law relate?
- The Spotify model just changed the names of the scrum teams in a matrix orginisation, and wanted to foster a good community in which you can grow a lot and talk with your peers. I.e they wanted to make changes, but did not really make structural changes, ending up in a status quo in the end.

How does Larman’s Law explain the change of vocabulary? And what happened there?
- **Any change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the existing roles and structures, so it does not threaten the status quo of these roles** 
	- they just redefined the roles and terms, but it is just the same as a matrix organisation
# 4 Load Testing
In this one spin up a local site to test on!

_DO NOT LOAD TEST AN SITE IN PRODUCTION THAT YOU ARE NOT THE OWNER OF! UNLESS EXPLICIT PERMISSION HAVE BEEN GIVEN!_

Try setting up Gatlink and create a test report using this tutorial: [Gatlink Quickstart](https://gatling.io/docs/current/quickstart/) .

Go through the generated scenario. Anything that stands out? Try to play around with the generated code.

# 5 Trademarks
Can the article from McKinsey&Company explain the problems with the “Spotify” Model? How does the McKinsey&Company article depect the organisation compared to “Spotify”?

This article mentions a Noth-Star, how could that have improved the “Spotify” model?
![[Pasted image 20231123105432.png]]
The article also mentions a "North Star" approach, which could be interpreted as a long-term strategic goal or direction that guides the organization's decisions and actions. While the article does not specifically mention how a North Star approach could have improved the Spotify model, it is reasonable to assume that having a clear, long-term strategic goal could help an organization like Spotify stay focused and make better decisions.
- Spotify was a little too agile in their autonomy, and lacked a north start towards what was the shared common goal

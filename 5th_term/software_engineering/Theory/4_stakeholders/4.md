# Context adaptive agility
http://www.toddlittleweb.com/Papers/Context%20Adaptive%20Agility%20IEEE%20S3028.pdf
Putting it all together, "context-adaptive agility" suggests an approach or mindset where an individual, team, or organization is not only agile but also adjusts their agility based on the specific context they are operating within. This might involve tailoring strategies, decision-making processes, or operational methods to align with the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the current situation.

## notes
- dogs: low complexity, low uncertatinty. In the cynnefin model it would be `best practise`. 
- skunks: simple zone in the cynnefin-model, we dont want to work with it has it has some uncertainty and not complex. 
- bull: in cynnefin it will chaotic, hard to adapt you. Projects in this quadrant may be profitable as it is so complex. But very risky
- colts: in the complex/chaotic in cynnefin
- cows: cash cows as it is tough to move into the market, but no uncertainty. Just a high yield.

## Users
Document your user, who are you satisfying. Fx create personas. Write down assumptions
become **user-centric**
becoming user-centric is a big part of **agile** as we have shorter feedback loops

> look at the bulletpoints on what to do with the users.
1. interviews with the users is a vey good idea to know what the users actually want
2. tests, test the actual product on the users to get very good feedback
3. track how different features performs, fx which `UI` is better

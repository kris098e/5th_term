## Scrum Pillars
optimize transparency, inspection and adaptationss
1. Transparency: Transparency is the foundation of Scrum and refers to the visibility of the project's progress, processes, and challenges. It involves sharing information openly and making it accessible to all team members and stakeholders[[2]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/3-pillars-scrum). Transparency ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the project's goals, progress, and impediments. It enables effective collaboration, trust, and accountability within the team.

2. Inspection: Inspection is the act of regularly and frequently examining the project's progress and the product itself[[2]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/3-pillars-scrum). It involves reviewing the work done, identifying any deviations from the plan or quality issues, and assessing the product's readiness for release. Inspection occurs at various points in the Scrum framework, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives[[2]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/3-pillars-scrum). By inspecting the project and product, the team can identify areas for improvement, address issues early on, and make informed decisions.

3. Adaptation: Adaptation is the process of making changes based on the findings from the inspection phase[[2]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/3-pillars-scrum). It involves adjusting the project plan, product backlog, and processes to address issues, incorporate feedback, and optimize the team's performance. Adaptation is an essential aspect of Scrum as it enables continuous improvement and allows the team to respond effectively to changing requirements and circumstances[[2]](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/3-pillars-scrum). It ensures that the team remains flexible, agile, and responsive throughout the project.

## Side effects
have to be careful that other guys does not just copy your product after they have seen your tests
## Examples

**Dropbox** is very nice example since they just use a video to showcase the use. Then it was seen it could be needed -> made the product and then refined it

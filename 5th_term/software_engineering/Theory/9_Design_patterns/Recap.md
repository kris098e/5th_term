# what is C.R.A.P
[[Lecture 9_ Design Patterns 2.pdf#page=29]]
- penalities for not testing
- penalties for having high cyclomatic complexity
- if we have low test coverage and high complexity, then we will be penaltiest by a lot
# What does a facade do
a gang of 4 design pattern
https://www.blackwasp.co.uk/gofpatterns.aspx
- Structural pattern
- The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.
# GoF
Gang of Four
# Guideline for Cyclomatic Complexity
How many branches in the code
- Number of decisions your code
- you define yourself the limit
# Code Rot
- Another word for technical debt
	- fx too much duplications in the code
	- developing code via known anti-patterns
	- unnecessary complexity...
- Used to identify problems

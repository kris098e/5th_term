The article "Product Success" by Marty Cagan discusses the characteristics of successful product teams and how they operate. The author shares ten key attributes of successful product teams, based on the Continuous Discovery and Delivery model, also known as Dual Track Agile or Discovery Sprints and Delivery Sprints.

1. **Empowered Product Teams**: The author emphasizes the importance of a strong product team. The team should be durable, have a good chemistry among its members, and have a diverse skill set. Co-location of the team is also beneficial.

2. **Product Vision and Strategy**: The team should have a deep understanding of the broader business context, which includes a clear and compelling product vision and a well-defined product strategy.

3. **Focus on Business Outcomes**: The team should focus on solving business problems rather than just shipping features. The OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system is recommended to facilitate this.

4. **Collaboration-driven Solutions**: The author suggests that the three main skills – product, design, and engineering – should collaborate to solve problems. This collaboration is key to coming up with good solutions.

5. **Product Discovery: Learn Fast**: The team should be able to try out many ideas quickly to learn which ones will work and which ones won't. This process, known as product discovery, is crucial for minimizing waste.

6. **Focus on Key Risks**: The team should focus on four key risks: value risk, usability risk, feasibility risk, and stakeholder risk. These risks should be addressed before building and delivering a product.

7. **The Role of an MVP**: An MVP should be seen as a test or an experiment, not as a product. It should be a fraction of building a real product.

8. **Product Delivery: Release with Confidence**: The team should not release software that they know is not ready. It's important to have the necessary confidence in a release before it goes to production.

9. **Obsess Over Customers**: The team should have a strong relationship with customers. This can be achieved by connecting the team directly to customers.

The author concludes by emphasizing that the best product teams are those that obsess over customers and focus on learning fast, collaboration-driven solutions, and releasing software with confidence [1](https://www.svpg.com/product-success/).

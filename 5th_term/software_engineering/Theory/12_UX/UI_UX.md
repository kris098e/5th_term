# UX
- user experiences
	- how you move between the screens and touchpoints
	- create a positive experience with the product

## Research
super key to move forward. Have to know who we will make the experience for
## Analysis
### Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/x
## Design
1. initial visuals
2. compare visuals
3. find a flow to go with
### Mobile first approach
- which places should be centered and easy to reach, and where should the other things be
### Start by creating the landing page
### Creating wireframes and prototypes
- wireframes: the flow of which page you will get to when you click on something
- prototypes: create the prototypes first before finalizing logic
#### Different prototypes

https://www.svpg.com/high-fidelity-prototypes/
- just for throwaway
	- most of all PoC, can it be done

- high-fidelity means that we will implement a lot
- low-fidelity just a piece of paper or something which shows the idea
- Live Data prototypes
	- we usually use artificical data for prototypes. This may scew the prototype to work. Using real data may let us discover bugs
	- Use read-only data! as this will use production data
	- A/B testing, meaning some of the users gets 1 thing and another group gets something else, and see what works the best.
- hybrids
	- mix the different prototypes, fx high-fidelity with live data

## Validation / testing
- give it to someone else in the office, and see how the design is behaving and how the users like it.
- can also do it `externally`, recruit testers which matches the user-base
- surveys
## Dark patterns
- patterns to lure or manipulate certain behaviour
	- easy to get in, difficult to escape

# UI
- user interface
- making it look pretty
	- simple and clean interfaces
## Design systems
- where to start, have initial components
- many out there
## Design tools
- figma
- sketch
- adobe illustrator

# UX challenge
## Analysis
### Jakob Nielsens 10 heuristics

#### Ryanair
##### Visibility
Really delayed with the pricing, did not end up with the price I thought i would end up giving. Ended up paying 200DKK more

But overall it is easy to use, and clear what I have to do at each of the steps
##### Mapping
##### User control
RYANAIR cannot go back easily, have to use `go back button` in chrome.
##### Consistency
##### Error prevention

have to estimate how much time things will take, and how much money will be made.

The article titled "Product Fail" by Marty Cagan discusses the common pitfalls in product development and offers insights into how to avoid them. It outlines a critique of the traditional product development process, which it argues is often project-centric and lacks the flexibility and agility of Agile methodologies.

The author begins by describing the typical product development process, which starts with ideas from executives or stakeholders. These ideas are then prioritized and a business case is created for each idea, focusing on how much money it will make and how much it will cost. This process is then used to create a product roadmap.

Cagan criticizes this process for several reasons:

1. It is sales-driven and stakeholder-driven, leading to products that are not necessarily the best solutions to the problems at hand.
2. It is project-centric, leading to orphaned projects that don't meet their objectives.
3. It is risk-averse, with customer validation happening too late in the process.
4. It is wasteful, as it involves designing, building, testing, and deploying features that may not meet customer needs.
5. It is slow and expensive, as it doesn't allow for rapid iterations and continuous improvement.

Cagan also discusses the role of product management and design in this process, arguing that they are often undervalued and misused. He points out that engineering is often brought in too late, and that design is often added as an afterthought, rather than being integrated from the start.

The author concludes by suggesting that the best teams operate differently, focusing on product discovery and continuous delivery. They replace features on roadmaps with business problems to be solved, and aim for product/market fit. He encourages companies to transition from the old process to a more modern, agile approach, to avoid being disrupted by startups or competitors that can move faster and more effectivelyÂ [1](https://www.svpg.com/product-fail/).

## breaches of IEEE ethics
The IEEE Code of Ethics and Professional Practice provides a set of principles that guide the conduct of software engineers. Breaches of these principles can occur in various ways in the field of software engineering. Here are a few examples:

1. **Principle 8 – SELF**: This principle emphasizes the importance of personal development and self-improvement for software engineers. Breaches of this principle could occur if a software engineer fails to improve their skills, knowledge, and understanding of the software and related documents on which they work. For instance, if a software engineer produces inaccurate, informative, or poorly written documentation, they would be breaching this principle [1](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).

2. **Principle 6 – PROFESSION**: This principle emphasizes the importance of a favorable organizational environment for ethical behavior and the promotion of the public interest. Breaches of this principle could occur if a software engineer promotes their own interest at the expense of the profession, client, or employer, or if they fail to obey all laws governing their work [1](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).

3. **Principle 3 – PRODUCT**: This principle emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of software and data. Breaches of this principle could occur if a software engineer uses inaccurate data, fails to maintain the integrity of data, or treats software maintenance with less professionalism than new development [1](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).

In addition to these examples, there are also potential breaches of the IEEE Code of Ethics and Professional Practice in the broader context of software engineering. For instance, a software engineer could breach the principles if they promote a business or organization that conflicts with the code, or if they fail to take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in software and associated documents on which they work [1](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).

It's important to note that the IEEE Code of Ethics and Professional Practice is not a simple ethical algorithm that generates ethical decisions. In some situations, standards may be in tension with each other or with standards from other sources. These situations require the software engineer to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which is most consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, given the circumstances [1](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics).

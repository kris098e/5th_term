# What is it
A decision-framework, to take decisions of what to do given some situation

# primary notes
you would not want to be in the simple state, as you always want to be analyzing to improve, and make improvement to the product.
If you are in the simple state, then you dont want to improve and you dont even think about it

`complicated, obvious` are both ordered systems since there is some correlation between cause and efftect
`complex, chaotic` are called unordered systems

In the `complex` area most software projects are located, since we fx work with people

We have a bias on which area we are in, due to our previous experience
# Notes
pronounced "kannevin", the nature of systems

One size does not fit all, handle the case with the situation in mind

The model/framework is used in all sorts of situations, such as project management, programming ...

**if we are in a state for too long we start to think every new problem is the exact scenario**

problems usually go through the phases, i.e going from chaotic -> Emergent practice -> .. -> obvious

fx if we already know what to do, and we have done it before, we can start in the complicated zone, and we can actually use the **watterfall model as we have done it before**

The `disorder`-state is where we are most of the time, handling each situation as sense of our own personal preference and experience.
1. Chaotic requires to stabilize the situation such that we can move into the complex zone.
2. Complex means we have do not have a clue of what to do yet, but we can get to the complicated area by bringing in lots of knowledge and have experts experiment. If the experiments goes to plan then we amplify the experiment, if not we dampen it
3. complicated means we need experts to analyze the situation, but we have done it before, so we can move forwards, choosing one of the methods which works
4. Obvious means we already know which method works the best, and we can just use this method to get to an accept state.

# Examples
## Obvious
padel, you were set up - punish

print "hello world"

have done it many times and can eyeball everything
## Complicated
padel - setup a playtomic match, you know what to do, you have done it before, but it is still hard to setup

print hello world in assembly

have the recipe, have to follow the recipe and read it along the way
## Complex
padel - new padel makker, you cannot know how to communicate before you have tried it.

print hello world in bytecode

Create recipes 
## Chaotic
the opponent does something really weird, fx takes his pants off. Extremely chaotic, how to proceed?

make the machine that can print the hello world. Have no clue where to start

You put too much salt into the dish, what do you do?
## disorder
The opponent starts moaning. Is it ok? complicated cause you wanna leave?
The opponent does not show up - you already paid, should you go home, charge him for wasting your time?

print hello world when you have no clue about what a computer is

# Pyramid of results
Which culture the company has
- results
- actions
	- influences our results
- beliefs
	- what do the people believe in
		- fx do they value testing
		- value teamwork ...
	- how do we change these beliefs?
- experiences
	- this is how we will change the beliefs

## Old school
managers are in the actions, defining what the teams should do
## New school
leaders will provide the experiences influencing what will happen.
## Line organisation
`see Larmans Law in notes in directory`
## The matrix model
## The spotify model (is a matrix model)
- try to use new word to redefine the meaning of certain common things

The Spotify model is a framework for scaling Agile practices, developed by Spotify in 2011. It's based on the idea of decentralizing decision-making and empowering teams to complete projects using whatever Agile methodology they see fit. The model is centered around simplicity and was designed to enable Squads to move fast, ship software quickly, and do so with minimum pain and overhead [1](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify), [4](https://producthq.org/agile/agile-spotify-model/).

The Spotify model consists of four main elements: Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds [7](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Spotify_Model):

- **Squads**: These are self-organizing teams that work on a specific product or feature. Each squad is managed by a product owner and is responsible for its own development process. 
	- should be co-located
	- defines own model for teamwork, fx kanban, scrum ...
	- seen as a `mini-start up` where they are responsible for their own thing, and take ownership of it.

- **Tribes**: Tribes are groups of Squads that share the same area of expertise. They provide a network for sharing knowledge and best practices. Dont have too big tribes, as it will lose the communication part as you cannot talk with everyone, and you may even end up with smaller tribes in the big tribe (Dunbar Number)
	- Tribe lead
	- 

- **Chapters**: These are groups of people who share the same role or function across different Squads and Tribes. They provide a platform for cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.

- **Guilds**: Guilds are groups of people who share the same skills or interest. They provide a platform for continuous learning and improvement. Interest-based communities.
Can have Chapter and Guild lead

part of an ecosystem, need to collaborate with other teams. Have a leader which will manage which tasks to do, which you will plan with the leader, and then you can be anutonomous towards the common goal
we need `boundaries & constraints` to live by, to align of common goals. 
- recommendation
	- negotiable
- laws
	- mandatory
- guiding
	- optional
`Means 'OWNiNG IT'` means that the team and the individuals need to own the goal, and come to the goal with `boundaries & constraints`.
- Be `agile`

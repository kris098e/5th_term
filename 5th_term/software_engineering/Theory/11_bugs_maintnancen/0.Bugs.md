# Common cases where bugs are introduced
see slides
# Locating bugs
- if a bug is found, we start by doing TDD with e2e, making the bug happen again and fix it. Start by writing unit tests in the place where it happens and fix the bug, such that it passes.
# what to do about the bugs
- bug hunter 
	- person assigned to finding bugs and fixing them during the sprint
- extra slack
	- locate time in the sprint to fix fx bugs
- void the sprint
	- stop the sprint if the bug is too large, to fix a big bug
`depends on the bug what to do, and also the method agreed on in the team`
# Pyramid of results
Which culture the company has
- results
- actions
	- influences our results
- beliefs
	- what do the people believe in
		- fx do they value testing
		- value teamwork ...
	- how do we change these beliefs?
- experiences
	- this is how we will change the beliefs

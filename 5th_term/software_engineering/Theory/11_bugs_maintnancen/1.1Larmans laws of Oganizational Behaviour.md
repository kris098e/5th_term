Larman's Laws of Organizational Behavior were articulated by Craig Larman, co-creator of Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS), to provide a lens through which to analyze and understand the dynamics of change within organizations [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

1. **Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo middle- and first-level manager and specialist roles & power structures.** This law suggests that organizations are naturally inclined to maintain the status quo, especially at the middle and first-level manager and specialist roles. Any change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the existing roles and structures, so it does not threaten the status quo of these roles [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

2. **As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the existing roles and structures, so it does not threaten the status quo of middle- and first-level manager and specialist roles.** This means that any change in the organization is likely to be seen as a way to preserve the status quo rather than as a real change [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

3. **As a corollary to (1), it is easier to move the Scrum roles around to fit the existing organization, than it is to change the organization to fit the Scrum roles.** This suggests that it is easier to adapt Scrum roles to fit the existing organization than it is to change the organization to fit the Scrum roles [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

4. **Culture follows structure.** This law suggests that structural changes often precede cultural shifts. For example, fostering a culture of innovation within an organization is not about simply encouraging creativity and hoping that a culture of innovation will emerge. Instead, it's about implementing structural changes — creating cross-functional teams, removing bureaucratic hurdles, and incentivizing risk-taking — that enable a culture of innovation to thrive [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

These laws provide a brutally honest insight into the inertia that exists within organizations and underline the considerable challenge of driving genuine, transformative change [2](https://innovationtalks.substack.com/p/larmans-laws-of-organizational-behavior).

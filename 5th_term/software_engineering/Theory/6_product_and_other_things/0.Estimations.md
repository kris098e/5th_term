- Size an effort (time, story points, )
	- is it worth it
# Story points
- should be relative to each other
	- should not be per person view, as this will provide some chaos

**carsten said a lot**: `Dont use story points as an estimate of velocity`
## Should not be
based on
- complexity
- time
## Should be
based on
- effort
	- mix of time, complexity and uncertainty
## different scales
1. fibbonachi
2. natural numbers
3. $10^x$

- helps to remove bias
- use common baseline
- evolves over time

# INVEST model for increments / tasks

- **I**ndependent: This means that each user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story. User stories should not depend on the outcome of another user story to be completed. This makes it easier to prioritize and schedule user stories.

- **N**egotiable: User stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten. It's not a contract for work to be done, but a placeholder for a conversation.

- **V**aluable: A user story must deliver value to the end user. It should be a measurable increment of functionality adding value for the user.

- **E**stimable: It needs to be possible to estimate how much work the user story will require. This doesnâ€™t mean to the day, but to a reasonable degree of certainty.

- **S**pecific: tasks should be specific, to not waste time on ambiguity

- **T**estable: The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.
# Poker planning
remove bias in how do we estimate

everybody in the team gets a set of cards,

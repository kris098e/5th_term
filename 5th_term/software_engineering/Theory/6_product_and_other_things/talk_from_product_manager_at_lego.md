### Motivation
In summary, the Opportunity Tree and OKRs complement each other in the strategic planning process. The Opportunity Tree helps identify and define opportunities and solutions, while OKRs provide a framework for setting and tracking objectives and outcomes.
### OKRs
These are fx defined for an entire quater or even more sometimes. This is _the reason the team exists_ for that specific quater. Sometimes developers just pumps out **output**, however there may not be any **outcomes** from it. If we have no outcomes, we get not **impact** from the team. `follow the OKR`

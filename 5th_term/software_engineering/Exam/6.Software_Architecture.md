# Software Architect
hvad er dette
UML
- components
- interfaces
# Code rot
god arkitektur vil minimere code rot idet man fx f√•r bedre struktur. High cohesion low coupling. Funktioner kan genbruges

# Coupling
- if we have two boxes in an UML-diagram, which has many arrows to eachother, then we have high coupling.
	- we cannot change the one class, without changing much in the 2nd class aswel
		- code is hard to maintain
# Cohesion
